    <p class="matter">
      This website was developed by Hadifa Rousheen (21271A0574) CSE-B.The main
      aim of this project is to solve the problem faced by the students who take
      books from libray but forgets to return or renewal on time.Due to this
      they have to pay fine.
    </p>
    <p class="matter">
      To save your money I have come with the project JITS LIBRARY BOOKS
      TRACKER.so that you can keep track of the books which you took from
      library.The best part of this website is it sends you the notification
      when the renewal date or the return date is near.
